Grain of Sand is a web app that decodes/encodes [What3Words](https://what3words.com/) addresses. Users can search for addresses, What3Words addresses, longitude/latitude, or landmarks. All map markers can be toggled to look for either the address or the What3Words address parcel. The goal of Grain of Sand is to allow users to search for locations that do not have an actual address and can instead use What3Words addresses. 

The project utilized multiple APIs and implemented a RESTful Flask framework.
